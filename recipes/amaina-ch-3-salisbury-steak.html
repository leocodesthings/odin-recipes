    <li>300g mixed pork and beef</li>
    <li>1 onion</li>
    <li>1/2 egg</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons bread crumbs</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>dash of pepper</li>
    <li>1 tablespoons olive oil</li>

    <li>1 400g can diced tomatoes</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Mince the <b>onion</b> and cook it thoroughly in the <b>olive oil</b> until translucent, then take it out and let cool.<br>Soak the <b>breadcrumbs</b> in the <b>milk</b>.<br>Beat the <b>egg</b>.</li>
    <li>Put the <b>meat</b> into a bowl and mix with <b>salt</b> and <b>pepper</b> until combined. Add the ingredients from <b>Step 1</b> (reserving half of the onion) and mix it until it starts to stick together.</li>
    <li>Divide what you made in <b>Step 2</b> into three or four portions and toss them between your hands to help the meat bind. Shape into patties and make a little depression in the middle using your finger.</li>
    <li>Using the frying pan from <b>Step 1</b>, cook the patties from <b>3</b>. (If it's not a non-stick frying pan, put down some oil.) Cook on medium heat. Once both sides are browned, remove and put on a plate.</li>
    <li>Add a small amount of <b>olive oil</b> to the frying pan from <b>Step 4</b>. Add sauce ingredients <b>A</b> and cook on low heat. Once they start to smell good, put in the rest of the onions from <b>Step 1</b> and the <b>canned tomatoes</b>. Add the ingredients from <b>B</b> and stew for about 5 minutes. Then return the patties to the pan, cover, and stew for 7 minutes.</li>
    <li>Take out the <b>bay leaves</b>, then reduce the sauce, stirring occasionally so it doesn't burn.</li>
